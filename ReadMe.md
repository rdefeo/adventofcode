# Advent Of Code

My attempts at the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) puzzles. Solutions are in a combination of Python and C++, depending on year. After submitting the answers, I usually revisited the code to clean it up, maybe add some comments, and in general, make it more readable. I definitely did not strive for the shortest solution.

The earlier years had some C++ solutions, but then I transitioned to python. I wouldn't call these solutions "good code" but they work!
